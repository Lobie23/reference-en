SimpleSub()
[Sketch]
Description
The simplest form of subroutine. Any valid usefull name may be used 'mysub()' that does not conflict reserved words or other variables. 

Example Code

void loop() {
    // other lines of program to run every time loop executes
    if (true) {
        SimpleSub() ;       //call SimpleSub  
    }
}

                      //  Define your SimpleSub 
                      //  Can be before or after 'void loop() {.....}' but must be outside all other functions '{......}' 
void SimpleSub() {
                      //  code to run each time SimpleSub() is called
}

Notes: This is very similar to void loop(), which is a unique case in that the micro calls loop() repeatedly after setup().
No arguments are passed in this form. It is possible to pass arguments to a subroutine, and a subroutine may return a value in this case the 'void' specifies that nothing  will be  returned.
